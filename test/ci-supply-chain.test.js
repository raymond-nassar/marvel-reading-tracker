// A workflow step runs third-party code on a runner holding a token for this repository.
// `actions/checkout@v7` is not a version, it is a subscription: the tag is a pointer its owner
// can move, so the build agrees in advance to run whatever they publish next. Pinning a full
// commit revision is what turns that back into a decision someone made once and can be shown to
// have made.
//
// The three properties below are each cheap to lose in a one-line edit and invisible when lost,
// which is why they are held here rather than by the comments beside them.

// Every workflow the repository has, not the one this was written against. An enumeration is a
// list someone has to remember to extend, and a second workflow added later is exactly when the
// pinning discipline would lapse unnoticed. `git ls-files` is how the anchors gate enumerates for
// the same reason, and it inherits the same property: it sees tracked files only. That is right
// here, because a contributor's new workflow reaches CI tracked or not at all, but it means a
// local run cannot judge a file that has not been added yet.
//
// `.github/actions` is swept too, though nothing lives there yet. A composite action is a place
// `uses:` can be written that is not a workflow, so leaving it out would make the enumeration the
// very thing the paragraph above says not to build.
