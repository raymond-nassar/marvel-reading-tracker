// who is somehow on an origin that is not treated as secure, still has a working tracker. The
// offline launch is the thing that is lost, and it is the only thing that is lost.

// Resolved against the document rather than against this module. The worker's scope is the
// directory it is served from, so a worker fetched from js/lib/ would only ever see requests for
// js/lib/, and the navigation that matters is the one for the page itself. index.html sits at
// the root of what is served, so this reaches src/sw.js and takes the whole app as its scope.
