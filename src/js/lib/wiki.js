// The two requests behind the hand-entry lookup.
//
// This is deliberately the only file in the app that names a third party the reader did not ask
// for by installing it. Constraint 3 promises no accounts, no cloud services and no telemetry, on
// the basis that nothing is uploaded anywhere, so a new outbound request has to earn its place:
//
//   * it is never automatic. Nothing here runs unless the reader presses the lookup button.
//   * it sends the words in the Title box and nothing else. No list, no progress, no issue id,
//     no cookie and no referrer. The two options that guarantee the last two are set below.
//   * it is disclosed beside the button that fires it, and in the three places the privacy copy
//     test holds to the same standard.
//
// It is also the only file that talks to this host, so the whole of the app's exposure to the
// wiki is one function with an injectable fetch, which is what lets the request shape be tested
// without a network.
