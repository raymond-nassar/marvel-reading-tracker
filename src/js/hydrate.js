// Background metadata hydration for issues imported from Markdown.
//
// A Markdown checklist only carries a title and an issue id. Everything the UI needs
// (digitalId, series, dates) requires one /v1/issues/{id} call each, and the rate limiter
// caps that at 45/minute, roughly five minutes for a 219-issue order. So hydration is
// incremental, cancellable, resumable, and prioritises whatever you are about to read.
